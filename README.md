## Who We Are

Before getting started, it's important to understand OpenMined's mission:<br>
To **lower the barrier to entry to privacy preserving technology.**
<br><br>
This means that we want to help **you** by both making your products and research better, **and** protecting you along the way.
<br><br>
The OpenMined community does most of its communicating on Slack. If you haven't joined our Slack team yet, [click here to join](https://slack.openmined.org)!

## Teams
OpenMined's teams are split into 3 categories: [development](https://github.com/4mber/OM-Welcome-Package/tree/master/Development%20Teams), [community](https://github.com/4mber/OM-Welcome-Package/tree/master/Community%20Teams), and [research](https://github.com/4mber/OM-Welcome-Package/tree/master/Research%20Teams), so there is room for everyone to contribute! The goal of this Beginner's Guide is to help you know the best place for you to fit into the community, and to get you started on your path to contributing in your unique way.
