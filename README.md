## Who We Are

Before getting started, it's important to understand OpenMined's mission:<br>
To **lower the barrier to entry to privacy preserving technology.**
<br><br>
This means that we want to help **you** by both making your products and research better, **and** protecting you along the way.
<br><br>
The OpenMined community does most of its communicating on Slack.<br>

## Teams
OpenMined's teams are split into 3 categories: [development](https://github.com/4mber/OM-Welcome-Package/tree/master/Development%20Teams), [community](https://github.com/4mber/OM-Welcome-Package/tree/master/Community%20Teams), and [research](https://github.com/4mber/OM-Welcome-Package/tree/master/Research%20Teams), so there is room for everyone to contribute! The goal of this Beginner's Guide is to help you know the best place for you to fit into the community, and to get you started on your path to contributing in your unique way.

## Getting Started

<br><br>
### Join Slack
The first thing you should do is [join our Slack community](https://slack.openmined.org). This is the best place to ask questions, meet other team members, and stay up to date on what's going on in the community.<br>

Once you have joined the Slack organization, there are many channels that you can join for help and community, including:

- **Location Based Channels:**  Search for the closest major city or your country name to chat with others from your area!
- **Topic Based Channels:**  Start your search with topic_, for instance, *#topic_beginner_questions* or *#topic_jobs_in_ai*
- **Community Channels:**  Start your search with community_, for instance, *#community_udacity_course* or *#community_women-of-om*
- **Library Channels:**  For questions/communication about specific OpenMined libraries. Start your search with lib_, for instance, *#lib_pysyft, #lib_pygrid, #lib_pydp, #lib_syft_js, #lib_syfertext,* etc.

<br><br>
### Apply for Mentorship
Next, you should [join our mentorship program](https://forms.gle/6b3HXZtufMwa9cxaA). OpenMined Mentors are here to help you get started, and to walk you through the steps to becoming an active member of OpenMined.

To get an idea of what you can expect once joining the mentorship program, check out our [Mentorship Program infographic](/images/Mentorship-PROGRAM-2020-EXTERNAL.pdf). This is the program that your mentor will walk you through, from choosing a goal team to join, submitting your first pull request, working your way through our learning materials, applying for a team, to what comes after joining a team.
