## Who We Are

Before getting started, it's important to understand OpenMined's mission:<br>
To **lower the barrier to entry to privacy preserving technology.**
<br><br>
This means that we want to help **you** by both making your products and research better, **and** protecting you along the way.<br><br>
[Check out OpenMined's 2020 Roadmap for more about how we plan to make this happen!](https://github.com/OpenMined/Roadmap)

<br><br><br>

## Teams

OpenMined's teams are split into 3 categories: [development](https://github.com/4mber/OM-Welcome-Package/tree/master/Development%20Teams), [community](https://github.com/4mber/OM-Welcome-Package/tree/master/Community%20Teams), and [research](https://github.com/4mber/OM-Welcome-Package/tree/master/Research%20Teams), so there is room for everyone to contribute!

To get started working on these projects, check out our [tutorials](#learning) below.<br><br><br>


## Getting Started

<br><br>
### Join Slack
The first thing you should do is [join our Slack community](https://slack.openmined.org). This is the best place to ask questions, meet other team members, and stay up to date on what's going on in the community.<br>

Once you have joined the Slack organization, there are many channels that you can join for help and community, including:

- **Location Based Channels:**  Search for the closest major city or your country name to chat with others from your area!
- **Topic Based Channels:**  Start your search with topic_, for instance, *#topic_beginner_questions* or *#topic_jobs_in_ai*
- **Community Channels:**  Start your search with community_, for instance, *#community_udacity_course* or *#community_women-of-om*
- **Library Channels:**  For questions/communication about specific OpenMined libraries. Start your search with lib_, for instance, *#lib_pysyft, #lib_pygrid, #lib_pydp, #lib_syft_js, #lib_syfertext,* etc.
<br>

<br><br>
### Apply for Mentorship
Next, you should [join our mentorship program](https://forms.gle/6b3HXZtufMwa9cxaA). OpenMined Mentors are here to help you get started, and to walk you through the steps to becoming an active member of OpenMined.

To get an idea of what you can expect on joining the mentorship program, check out our [Mentorship Program infographic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a_jk6juN7pNyXpPJo2X9ZIMoQv6v1Psv/view?usp=sharing).
<br><br>

    <img alt="Mentorship Program Thumbnail" src="/images/mentorship-thumb.png" width="450">
  </a>
</div>

<br>
This is the program that your mentor will walk you through, from choosing a goal team to join, submitting your first pull request, working your way through our learning materials, applying for a team, to what comes after joining a team.<br><br>

## Learning

### Introductory Videos
A good way to get an overview of the technology OpenMined uses, is to watch one of [Andrew Trask](https://github.com/iamtrask)'s presentations. Here are two examples, one shorter and one longer, that will give you a good starting point:

- **15 Minutes:** [Privacy Preserving AI - Andrew Trask, OpenMined. | DevCon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJBBE_SN90A)<br>

<br><br>

### Learning Initiatives

[**The OpenMined Learning Team**]() is also here to help you get started and work through the materials above! To join one of our cohorts, bootcamps, or study/discussion groups, [join our Slack org](https://slack.openmined.org) and join the channel _#community_om-learners_!

<br>

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://blog.openmined.org/announcing-the-openmined-learning-team/">
    <img alt="Learning Team Thumbnail" src="/images/learning-thumb.png" width="450">
  </a>
</div>

<br>

For more help from the community as you work through these materials, [**check out our other Slack channels above**](#join-slack). You can ask for help in the _#topic_beginner_questions_ channel, or the specific channel for the library you're working on (beginning with _#lib__).<br>

We also understand that many people within our community are not machine learning engineers professionally, so we have put together a list of [**Beginner Friendly OpenMined Terminology**](Beginner-Friendly-OM-Terms.md) that one might hear when working inside this community. [Check that out here](Beginner-Friendly-OM-Terms.md), and feel free to create issues for any terms you would like to see added to this list!
