## OpenMined's Mission

Before getting started, it's important to understand OpenMined's mission, to
**lower the barrier to entry to privacy preserving technology.** This means that we want to help **you** by both making your products and research better, **and** protecting you along the way.

<br><br><br>

## Community Structure

OpenMined is a community broken into various teams, and we all work together on Slack! There will be more about how to use our Slack organisation later, but if you haven't yet, [go join OpenMined's Slack here](slack.openmined.org). 

OpenMined's teams are both development and community related, so there is room for everyone to contribute! The goal of this Beginner's Guide is to help you know the best place for you to fit into the community, and to get you started on your path to contributing in your unique way.

**Below is a list of all of our teams**, as well as all of the information you need to join. This will give you an idea of all of the options for contributing, after which we'll share some information on how to get started. *Any time you see an "@", that's a member's Slack handle!*
