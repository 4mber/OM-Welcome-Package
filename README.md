## Who We Are

Before getting started, it's important to understand OpenMined's mission:<br>
To **lower the barrier to entry to privacy preserving technology.**
<br><br>
This means that we want to help **you** by both making your products and research better, **and** protecting you along the way.<br><br>
[Check out OpenMined's 2020 Roadmap for more about how we plan to make this happen!](https://github.com/OpenMined/Roadmap)

<br><br><br>

## Teams
OpenMined's teams are split into 3 categories: [development](https://github.com/4mber/OM-Welcome-Package/tree/master/Development%20Teams), [community](https://github.com/4mber/OM-Welcome-Package/tree/master/Community%20Teams), and [research](https://github.com/4mber/OM-Welcome-Package/tree/master/Research%20Teams), so there is room for everyone to contribute!

## Getting Started

<br><br>
### Join Slack
The first thing you should do is [join our Slack community](https://slack.openmined.org). This is the best place to ask questions, meet other team members, and stay up to date on what's going on in the community.<br>

Once you have joined the Slack organization, there are many channels that you can join for help and community, including:

- **Location Based Channels:**  Search for the closest major city or your country name to chat with others from your area!
- **Topic Based Channels:**  Start your search with topic_, for instance, *#topic_beginner_questions* or *#topic_jobs_in_ai*
- **Community Channels:**  Start your search with community_, for instance, *#community_udacity_course* or *#community_women-of-om*
- **Library Channels:**  For questions/communication about specific OpenMined libraries. Start your search with lib_, for instance, *#lib_pysyft, #lib_pygrid, #lib_pydp, #lib_syft_js, #lib_syfertext,* etc.
